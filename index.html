        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I have been a salesperson for 30 years, most of it in radio, TV and internet advertising sales. I've always been intrigued by the web, and plan on building a 2nd career around internet marketing. I am smart enough to know I can always learn more from others, and am thirsty for that knowledge.  Above all, I guess I'm a regular man with an irregular determination to fulfill a destiny I have dreamed for myself.   </p>
        <p>The most important thing in my life is my family. I was fortunate to grow up with the best parents and best brother in the world, and cherish them dearly.</p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>I've enjoyed saltwater aquaria for over 20 years, and I also enjoy working out.</p>
        <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
        <p>I'd love to be able to wake up in the morning anywhere on the planet, and sit at my laptop working on my web business. In addition, once a month I'd teach a seminar or course to help others fulfill their dreams.     </p>
